  <span class="headline">Math Vocabulary Builder</span>
 
</h1>

## Core Idea

A simple web platform that functions as a personal, user-specific dictionary for mathematical terms. Users can sign up, log in, and then Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) their own entries, which include a mathematical term, its definition, an example, and a category. This ensures that each user builds and manages their own private collection of mathematical vocabulary for effective study and review.

## User Stories:

* 	**Sign Up:** As a new user, I want to be able to create an account with a username, email, and password, so that I can gain access to my personal dictionary.
* 	**Log In**: As a registered user, I want to be able to log in using my email and password, so that I can view and manage my terms.
* 	**Log Out:** As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account, to ensure the security of my private dictionary.
* 	**Create (Add):** As a user, I want to add a new math term (including its name, definition, example, and category), so that I can build my personal vocabulary.
* 	**Read (List):** As a user, I want to view a list of all terms that I have personally added, so that I can quickly review my dictionary.
* 	**Read (Detail):** As a user, I want to see the full details of a specific term (name, definition, and example), so that I can understand it deeply during review.
* 	**Update (Edit):** As a user, I want to edit the details of any term I have added, so that I can correct or refine definitions and examples.
* 	**Delete:** As a user, I want to delete a term from my dictionary, so that I can remove unwanted or mastered entries.
* 	**Privacy:** As a user, I want to ensure that I cannot view, edit, or delete terms added by other users, to guarantee the privacy of my dictionary.
